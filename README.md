## About IronPHP

IronPHP is a development framework for PHP which
uses Front Controller, and MVC.

> **Note:** No stable release yet - [IronPHP Framework 1.0.12 alpha1](https://github.com/ironphp/ironphp/releases/tag/1.0.12-alpha1) version has been released. 
This repository contains the core code of the IronPHP framework. If you want to build an application using IronPHP, visit the main [IronPHP Application Skeleton](https://github.com/ironphp/app).

IronPHP is a web application framework for PHP which uses commonly known design patterns like Associative Data Mapping, Front Controller, and MVC. Our primary goal is to provide a structured framework that enables PHP users at all levels to rapidly develop robust web applications, without any loss to flexibility.

## Requirements

IronPHP requires PHP 7.2 or later; we recommend using the latest PHP version whenever possible.

## Installing IronPHP via Composer

You can install IronPHP into your project using
[Composer](https://getcomposer.org).

Download [Composer-Setup.exe](https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe) or update `composer self-update`.

If you're starting a new project, we
recommend using the [app skeleton](https://github.com/ironphp/app) as
a starting point. For existing applications you can run the following:

``` bash
$ composer require ironphp/ironphp:"@alpha"
```

## Update

Since this is a starting point for your application and various files
would have been modified as per your needs, there isn't a way to provide
automated upgrades atleast for NOT FOR NOW, so you have to do any updates manually.

## Configuration

Read and edit `Configuraton` in `.env`, `config/app.php` and setup the `Datasource` in `config/database.php`.

For each report, we try to first confirm the vulnerability. Once confirmed, the IronPHP will take the following actions:

- Acknowledge to the reporter that we’ve received the issue, and are working on a fix. We ask that the reporter keep the issue confidential until we announce it.
- Get a fix/patch prepared.
- Prepare a post describing the vulnerability, and the possible exploits.
- Release new versions of all affected versions.
- Prominently feature the problem in the release announcement.
